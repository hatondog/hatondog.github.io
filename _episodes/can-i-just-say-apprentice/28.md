description: Welcome back cherished listeners to another episode of Can I Just Say with Gemma, Stu, Siobhain and Sophisticated Sarah. This week the team gets giddy and attempts to do a Joe Rogan style 3 hour pod starting with cans and ending with whatever booze is in Gemmaâ€™s flat. Please enjoy the heavily edited final product and tweet us at @gemmaflynn @siobhainma and @stuartmcp if you want to hear the 2 hour long bonus ep that is largely about the career of Gerard Butler.
