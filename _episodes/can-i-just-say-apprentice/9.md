description: 9. Christmas Chocolate.

HUGE moments for Can I Just Say this week as Gemma invests in an Apprentice business and Stu receives a tweet from one of the candidates. If that’s not enough for you then maybe you are a whinger not a winner, but dw there is plenty to be said about the rich rich text that is ‘Santa’s Choco Seduction’.

As ever, follow us on @stuartmcp and @gemmaflynn and get in touch immediately if you find any Remoir Chocolat in the major retailer.
