description: Bonjour and welcome to another episode of your fave pod. Your cherished co-hosts take to their recording studio to remix this week’s episode and improve it, much like Mary Ann/Marianne/Marlyn’s singing. From Lottie’s bops to Claude’s nod, via Lord Sugar’s Dadaist airing of a 20-year beef with The Sugababes, you’d have to show real naive-eh-tie not to enjoy this classic ep. Remember to subscribe and leave ALL FIVE stars, and to follow ALL THREE on Twitter, where you can let us know how long you’ve been in the music industry.
