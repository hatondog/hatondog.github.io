description: Shocking scenes and frayed nerves in the Can You Just Say team as the “very clever” season 1 of YOU comes to an end.  Get in touch as ever at @gemmaflynn @siobhainma and @stuartmcp to tell us whether you think season 2 will contain more than a Paco and mum road trip or Joe on the run from the piss police.
