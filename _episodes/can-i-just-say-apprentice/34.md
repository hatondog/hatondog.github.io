description: Cherished listeners, please smell your hand to cleanse your palette and then join us this week in saying a big goodbye to Dean Lets Flats and big hello to a supremely entertaining ep. Though suffering in myriad ways (we (ALL THREE) were all drinking, Stuart had a cold and we all miss Thomas) we still found the energy to deep dive this rich, rich text and ask questions such as:
-Is it possible for a truly feminist product to exist within a Capitalist framework?
-Has Lewis ever met a woman or seen a bottle of perfume?
-Is it wise to leave Dean alone with a bag of grain?
There’s also lot for comedy fans to enjoy: it’s jokes aplenty this week as Kerrang rolls out her sink stuff and Lord Sugar develops his uniquely Dadaist interpretation of uneasy words and phrases.
