description: 5. Airlines. Can I Just Say is back and for some reason absolutely full of references to Stanley Kubrick. Join Stu and Gemma for more grubby behind the scenes info on Alan’s open mic career, Kurran’s future in the Disney universe and plans for a forthcoming roast-based Christmas episode of Can I Just Say.

Contact us if you want to be our intern at @stuartmcp and @gemmaflynn, we can offer as payment a university-level reference AND more info on CBBC’s Raven.
