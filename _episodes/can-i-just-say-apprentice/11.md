description: 11. The Final.<br /><br />It’s the last episode of the series and we’re delighted to Just Say that Kurran is back and better than ever. Dig deep with us for the final time as Stu wonders what it means to have drama in your hair and Gemma puts out an open call for listeners to wink at her from here on.<br /><br />Follow us on @gemmaflynn and @stuartmcp to let us know what direction the Can I Just Say brand should go in next and whether it should be &#39;luxe&#39;.
