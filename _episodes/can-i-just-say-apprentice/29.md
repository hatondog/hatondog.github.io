description: No Jemeflin (Gemma Flynn) this week so it’s down to The Lemsip Boys™ to discuss the iconic Apprentice ‘run about finding things’ week. Get on board for some big shagging news and, as always, a lotta Lottie bashing. Tweet us @siobhainma @gemmaflynn and @stuartmcp if you have any Apprentice news we should know about or how comes eggs are white.
