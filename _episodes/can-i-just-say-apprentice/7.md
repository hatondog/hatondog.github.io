description: 7. Glasgow Art. Itâ€™s the episode that fans of the pod have been hotly anticipating, we assume. This week The Apprentice comes to Glasgow and you best believe Can I Just Say are here to provide one of a kind insights into the fair city and reveal which of the team almost had a job interview at the place that bought the metal owl. Also, after some nudging, Stu has finally put pencil to paper on his first Apprentice artwork, while Gemma tries to start a broadcaster to broadcaster beef with Zane Lowe. You can contact us with tips or book us for your Christmas corporates @stuartmcp and @gemmaflynn.
