description: 8. TV Selling<br />This week Stu and Gemma have some company in the cupboard to help us make sense of the most dramatic episode of the series yet. Tune in as very special guest Siobhain Ma of Happy Spendy takes us through the ways in which The Apprentice has come to play an integral role in Glasgow’s DIY music scene. As ever, we continue to answer urgent behind the scenes questions such as ‘does Camilla like Ketchup’, Stu reveals his first finished painting and of course a good amount of time is spent considering Alan’s boiled beetroots.<br />Follow us on @siobhainma, @stuartmcp and @gemmaflynn to let us know if you want to get involved in a group candle syndicate.
