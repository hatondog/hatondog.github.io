description: Can I Just Say returns with a throwback lineup of Stu and Gemma who are missing cherished co-host and NY sub-team leader Siobhain. Siobhain fans will be delighted to enjoy a brief call in, meanwhile Stu and Gemma take things in a chill, almost ASMR direction, so kick back with some slime and enjoy, listen out for a brand new segment ‘Stucast’ and tweet us at @gemmaflynn @stuartmcp and @siobhainma to tell us if you would donate your dead body to the Alan Sugar Burial Society.
