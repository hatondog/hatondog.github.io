description: 6. Urban Gardening. Still very much struggling to say the name of their own podcast, Stu and Gemma are back to reveal that one of them has been too busy shaggin to do extra research for the show and the other has decided they might paint a picture of Sabrina. Different strokes for different folks over at Can I Just Say HQ, where as ever, we provide top of the line grubby Apprentice commentary to a backdrop of sirens.
