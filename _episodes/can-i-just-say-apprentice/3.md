description: Episode 3 sees the Apprentice contestants head to the Royal Albert Hall where they are then told to get in a car and go to Birmingham. This week Gemma and Stu go on a strange and fruitless journey of their own, in their case for improved sound quality, by huddling in a carpeted cupboard beside Gemma’s stored Christmas tree and an unused trampette.<br /><br />Follow us at @stuartmcp and @gemmaflynn, especially Gemma who is doing this mainly to get some of Stu’s followers.
