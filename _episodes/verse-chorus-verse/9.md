description: Alan Sparhawk from the minimalist indie-rock band Low talks about his personal songwriting process. Identifying ideas, putting the work in, and using techniques sparingly are all discussed. Listen to a fragment of a new song heâ€™s piecing together, as well as a more fleshed out live performance of a brand new, never-before-heard track.
