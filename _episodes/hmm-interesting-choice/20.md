guest: Gavin Crawford
number: 20
description: This month we get straight to the point and review an album considered by some as &quot;objectively bad music&quot;; Brokencyde&#39;s debut album &quot;I&#39;m Not A Fan But The Kids Like It&quot;. Is Crunkcore what the kids are listening to? And if so, is that a good thing? So many questions...
