description: In today&#39;s mini episode Martin gives John a blind review of the Leonard Cohen song &quot;Bird On The Wire&quot;. Martin likes Leonard Cohen, but does he like this particular song? Is this an improv gameshow? What happened to that homeless man? Will we start featuring the Hat on Dog mascot on every episode?
