description: If you thought Bruce Willis was just an actor then think again because today we reviewed his 1987 debut album &quot;The Return Of Bruno&quot;. We&#39;re joined by Michael Redmond as we all try to figure out if this is a joke, how it could be stopped in the future and who exactly this &quot;Bruno&quot; really is.
