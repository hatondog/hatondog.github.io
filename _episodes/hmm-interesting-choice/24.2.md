title: Captain Beefheart - Trout Mask Replica
guest: Gavin Crawford
number: 24.2
description: PART 2. The final stretch of the Captain Beefheart Trout Mask Replica marathon; surely a sprint finish, possibly a slamdunk. Will the boys descend into madness after being locked in a room together (with the Captain (and alcohol...?)) for so long?
