title: Captain Beefheart - Trout Mask Replica (pt2)
guest: Gavin Crawford
number: 24.2
description: (PART 2) The final stretch of the Captain Beefheart Trout Mask Replica marathon; surely a sprint finish, possibly a slamdunk. Will the boys descend into madness after being locked in a room together (with the Captain (and alcohol...?)) for so long?
